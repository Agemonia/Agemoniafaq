##  <a name="page_1" class="page-number">1.0</a> General

**When leveling up, do any uncompleted Scenarios from the previous levels get removed from the scenario pool or can they still be completed at the higher level?** When leveling up, the previous level’s scenarios (non-experience ones) do not get removed and may still be attempted even at a higher level. 

**If an Ally defeats an enemy with Revenge, do you still take the revenge damage?** Yes, but the damage is limited to the amount of health it had remaining (ex: If you did 7 dmg to an enemy with 3 health left, you would only take 3 revenge damage).

**During a multi-stage attack, will Inspiration Gems or other bonuses increase the damage/dice or each attack?** No, Inspiration Gems and other similar bonuses only affect one attack. 

**Do enemy shields reduce the attack damage from Henchmen, Allies and Pets?** Yes, enemy shields reduce damage from any form of attack (some higher shielded enemies will be particularly resistant to attack damage).

**Which areas are targeted with a Straight Line attack?** The straight line attack starts in an adjacent space (not your own space) and then affects the next X spaces in a straight line of sight from your area. So you have to be able to draw a straight line from your space through the other X spaces (similar to how line of sight works).

**Can you clarify the line of sight rules with areas at different heights?** If there’s a height difference between two areas (imagine a ledge), the character/enemy on the higher area bordering the height symbol has line of sight to the surrounding lower areas and can do an attack/ability (they can see down to surrounding lower areas). This only works if in the area bordering the height symbol. If however they are in an adjacent space (1 or more areas away from the area with the height symbol), they are too far from the ledge and can not see down. And vice-versa, the character/enemy on the lower areas can see up to the higher ledge, but only to the area that is bordering the height symbol (the edge of the ledge).

**If an area is at max capacity containing only Allies, and there are Enemies with Provoke adjacent, would an Ally who moves out to an adjacent empty area still take provoke damage because the enemy is considered in melee range?** No, while adjacent enemies can attack into your max capacity area, their provoke effects do not apply unless they have ranged provoke. 

**Do Enemies that are spawned mid-round still apply their provoke abilities?** Yes.

**Do Enemies adjacent to areas at full capacity cause Allies to be hindered?** No, they do not cause you to be hindered if they are not in your area (and therefore do not outnumber the allies in that area).

**Do large or huge enemies count as 2 or 3 enemies for the purpose of the Hindered Rule?** No, large and huge enemies are still considered as a single enemy for the purpose of being hindered. 

**For Group Ability Checks that allow you to choose an ability, does each Hero have to use the same ability when rolling, or can each Hero choose an ability (their strongest) to roll?** Each Hero may choose whatever ability they like (most likely their strongest).

**If an area has no capacity at all, is it possible to jump/teleport over it?** Yes, but only if the area has single or double white lines. You may not pass through solid barriers (red line borders).

**When an Enemy has an attack with damage and a push/pull effect, does it have to inflict some damage to trigger push/pull (as if push/pull was a condition)?** No, the push/pull will happen regardless if damage is inflicted or not.

**Can a Hero wear both a robe and an armor at the same time?** No, they both take up the same ‘armor’ slot which is 1 maximum per Hero.

**During an attack with Drain against a target with Riposte or Revenge, which triggers first?** Drain will happen first, then apply any Riposte or Revenge damage. 

**Are magic attacks made at range 0 always affected by the Obstructed Aim penalty (ex: one Hero and one Enemy in the same area)?** Yes, it is hard to hit someone in your own area (remember this only applies to magic attacks with a range, it does not apply to magic attacks that are area attacks).

**If you're making a ranged attack with another Ally in your area, are they obstructing your aim since the line of sight technically passes through the original area?** No, "passes through" is meant to indicate the areas between the attacker's area and the target's area.

**Do Push/Pull effects trigger Provoke?** No.

**Can a Hero/Enemy do a melee attack across a double white line to an adjacent area that is at max capacity?** Yes, as long as the two areas aren't of different heights.

**How does ranged Provoke work?** Ranged Provoke affects any Ally that moves out of ANY area within the provoke range of an Enemy (must also be in the Enemy’s line of sight). This means it can trigger moving towards, moving away, or moving around an Enemy. Keep in mind that an Ally may only suffer Provoke damage from the same Enemy once during their turn. 

**Ranged Provoke Example:** Archer has a provoke with range 1. The player:

- A. Moves from range 2 into range 1, doesn't take damage (moving into the provoke range doesn’t cause damage, must be moving out of an area within provoke range)
- B. Moves from range 1 to another range 1 area, takes damage
- C. Moves from range 1 into range 0, takes damage
- D. Moves from range 0 to range 1, takes damage
- E. Moves from range 1 to range 2, takes damage

**Will enemies avoid traps with their movement (for example to get into attack range)?** No, enemies will not try to avoid traps with their movement.

**If a story card required a maneuver to flip, can I spend the remainder of my current move maneuver to do so?** No, you have to spend an entire maneuver.  

**Are traps considered items?** No.

**Can two Heroes in the same space “share” a weapon and both make an attack with it during the same round (assuming they are not Hindered)?** Yes, weapon item cards could be passed back and forth between Heroes during the same round, just make sure to follow the rules of switching items to active items (one free weapon swap per turn, otherwise it costs 1 maneuver). Also remember, Hero specific items may never be traded, sold or discarded.

**If a Hero avoids taking damage from the Falling reactive check, do they still gain the Slowed condition?** No (see errata or updated rulebook).

**Can the special symbols on active checks (red dice) or reactive checks (blue dice) ever be used for multiple bonuses such as from items or Hero abilities?** No, each special symbol may only be used for 1 effect. The wording on several items and abilities have changed to include “may not use that die for any other purpose” (see 2nd Printing Rulebook, not in errata).

**Can a Hero move into an area at full capacity to perform an active check as long as you don’t end your turn there?** Yes, under the condition that there are no Enemies in said area and you move out on the same turn.

**Can achievement gems be used to give +1 move to movement gained herbs and potions?** No, achievement gems can only be used to add +1 movement to maneuvers and rethink actions.

**Can Inspiration Gems be used if they are gained before level 4?** Yes, they can be used at any level, as there are some ways to gain them before reaching level 4 (an event for example).

<div class="divider"></div>

## <a name="page_2" class="page-number">2.0</a> Conditions

**I seem to be missing condition tokens for Cursed, Blessed and Invisible?** There are no tokens for those three conditions, as Enemies can not become Cursed, Blessed or Invisible. Heroes use condition cards (all ten) and Enemies use tokens (use the cards to read the effect).

**Can an Ally or Enemy have multiples of the same condition (for example 2x Bless)?** No, an Ally or Enemy may not have the same condition more than once at the same time, and max 2 conditions total (see rulebook p.24).

**Does an enemy with the Dominated or Confused condition still move on its turn?** Yes, a Dominated or Confused enemy will still move as normal (see errata).

**If an Enemy has the weakened condition and performs an area attack, does the damage reduction apply to only the first Ally that takes damage or all the Allies being damaged?** It affects the whole attack, so reduce the damage for all the Allies in the area.

**If an Ally or Enemy gains a condition during their turn, does that condition affect their current turn or their next turn? Ex: gaining Stunned from moving on to a trap.** It will affect the remainder of that turn if possible. So an Enemy gaining Stunned from a trap will immediately end their turn, and an Ally gaining Stunned would lose their action or maneuver if it hasn’t been performed yet. Gaining Held or Slowed work a bit differently if gained during a move maneuver (see below).

**If an Ally or Enemy gains the Held or Slowed condition during a move maneuver (such as from a trap), does it immediately take effect and stop or reduce the current move?** No, conditions only take effect the next time they could. Example: receiving the Held condition while moving means the Ally/Enemy can finish that move normally and it will instead affect the Ally/Enemy’s next move maneuver.

**Can a Stunned or Dominated Enemy still provoke?** Yes.

**Can an Enemy’s Snake and Horn abilities be activated if it is Confused or Dominated?** Yes, those conditions do not affect the enemy's special abilities, only its attack.

**How do the Confused, Stunned and Dominated conditions work with the Focus Action?** **When exactly do you ‘perform’ the Focus Action?** The Focus Action is counted as ‘performed’ the first time your Hero rolls an extra die from its bonus. So if during a round your Hero were to gain the Confused, Stunned or Dominated condition but after you’ve already rolled an extra die from the Focus Action, then the condition to “miss your action” would be not end the Focus bonus for the current round, and instead affect the next time you would perform an action.

<div class="divider"></div>

## <a name="page_3" class="page-number">3.0</a> Professions

**Do you have to learn the basic talents on your Profession card from top to bottom?** No, you can learn them in any order. You automatically learn the topmost talent when you learn the profession (already marked). The bottom master talent is unlocked for purchase from level 3 onward, once you’ve learned all 5 basic talents.

**Can Profession talents be used during a scenario (such as crafting items)?** No, with the following exceptions: Alchemy: Herbalism » Pet Training: Beast Friendship » Runesmithing: Mining » Streetwise: Burglary and Perception

**Is there a limit to how many times a Hero can use an ability from their Profession?** No limit, as long as you can pay the cost each time.

**Pet Training: Can you use Combat Training multiple times to give +1 movement and provoke for each City Activity point spent?** Yes, see above.

**Can a Hero with Runesmithing craft and attach Runes to weapons and armor held by other Heroes?** Yes, as long as the Rune has a valid Rune slot to be attached to (a Rune card can not be held in your inventory by itself, it must be attached to a weapon or armor).

**During a City step, can a Hero with Toxicology take another Hero’s pet card 068 <span class="hidden">Nazag</span> to then craft item card 067 <span class="hidden">Nazag Venom</span> and also train it, then give <span class="hidden">Nazag</span> back to another player?** Yes. Items, including pets, can be traded during City steps.

<div class="divider"></div>

## <a name="page_4" class="page-number">4.0</a> Talents & Rituals (add-on card pack):

**Can Heroes learn both Master Talents for their profession?** Yes, and the cost is the same (5 star + 1 City Activity Point).

**How do I obtain the Ritual cards?** You gain the corresponding Ritual once you reach rank 2 (2 chevron symbol) with either Keepers of the Breach or the Jade Tendril.

<div class="divider"></div>

## <a name="page_5" class="page-number">5.0</a> City Step:

**Can you please clarify the order of the City steps?**
- Each Hero may visit as many locations as they want and use the services.
- When the party is ready, draw a City Event card and resolve it.
- Each Hero then collects their City Activity tokens (2 each typically) and then once again each Hero may visit as many locations as they want to use services, but may now also spend their City Activity tokens on activities at locations or in their personal Hero book.

**How many City Activity points does each Hero get per City step?** Each Hero receives 2 City Activity points per City step and may be spent on City activities after resolving the City event card. However, some abilities or effects might alter the amount of City Activity points a Hero receives.

**Can generic city activities be repeated more than once by each Hero? For example ‘Work on the Docks’ at Location B to earn 2 stars.** Unless the activity states that it can only be done once, it can be repeated multiple times by each Heroes.

**Can Heroes do City activities from previous levels in their Hero books?** No, only the current level’s activities are available for Heroes from their Hero book.

**What happens in the unlikely event that you get wounded during the City step?** Take an injury card, keep all your Stamina chips on their wound side, but do not take the wounded status. You may heal some damage before the next scenario starts.

**If a Hero Book City Activity says that other heroes may join, does it require a City Activity point/token from each hero?** Yes.

**Level 3/4/5 Location H:** <span class="hidden">**Can you disenchant illegal rare items?** Yes, they're quite happy to rid Agemonia of such things.</span>

**Level 3/4/5 Location L:** <span class="hidden">**Is the ‘Service: The Archive Vault’ supposed to be a solo or group activity?** The whole group may participate.</span>

**Level 4/5 Location G/H:** <span class="hidden">**There is a reason there is a 1 Star price discrepancy on Agura Crystal and Cube of Teleportation between level 4 and 5?** Yes, it is a mistake but it’s so minor that it wasn’t added to the errata.</span>

<div class="divider"></div>

## <a name="page_6" class="page-number">6.0</a> Pets:

**Do all pets have a figure/standee?** No, some pets are simply item cards (thematically these pets are just held on your Hero’s shoulder), while others have a figure which can be placed on the map and moved around (the pets with a figure will have a corresponding standee shown on the pet card).

**Are pets considered items for the purpose of not being able to pick them up while hindered or non-transferable with an ability like telekinesis?** Yes, pets are items therefore a Hero is not able to pick them up or transfer them with telekinesis while hindered. Confirm?

**Can pet figures be picked up while hindered?** Yes, while being hindered restricts picking up items, it does not restrict picking up a pet figure. Confirm?

**Can you start a move maneuver, then place a pet on the map and move it, and pick it up and then continue the move maneuver (for example, to scout a story point before choosing to move there or continue somewhere else)?** Yes, the rules do not specify you must finish your current action or maneuver prior to placing, picking up, or moving your pet.

**Can pet figures move or fall between two areas of different elevation?** No, unless the pet has the fly ability. Otherwise the pet would first have to be picked up by a Hero and carried up or down the elevation.

**Can pet figures pick up items or interact with Story cards?** No, pet figures are able to reveal Story cards but may not interact with them or pick up any items.

**Can pet figures move through traps?** Yes, pets can move through traps without triggering them.

**Item card 071** <span class="hidden">**Nazag: How does this pet work?** Nazag acts as a poison you can apply to certain weapons for an attack. Nazag needs to be your active pet (limit 1 per Hero, unless Pet Trainer profession), and your Hero needs to make an attack with a weapon with the poison symbol.</span>

**Item card 072** <span class="hidden">**Ophira: How many rerolls are allowed?** Rerolls may happen multiple times during the same active or reactive check, there is no limit on rerolls. You may keep rerolling all special symbols until you get a result that isn’t a special symbol (although occasionally you may want to stop rerolling to use the special symbol to get 2 successes with stamina from a red die, or an armor effect from a blue die).</span>

**Item card 072** <span class="hidden">**Ophira: Can you use this pet to reroll dice in King of Thieves?** No, Ophira only works with active/reactive ability checks or attack rolls.</span>

<div class="divider"></div>

## <a name="page_7" class="page-number">7.0</a> Item Cards:

**When can a Hero use item cards or item tokens?** At any time on their turn, except in the middle of an active/reactive check or attack unless they specify otherwise (i.e. You can’t use a Blightcap token in the middle of a test for extra stamina to spend). While it is not your Hero’s turn, the only items that can be used are items that involve a blue reactive check (ex: armor or helmets).

**Can you use an item card or item token during a move maneuver? For example, doing a move maneuver of 2 to move 1, then use a potion or token, then move 1 again.** Yes, as long as the item doesn’t cost a maneuver (you can’t spend a partially used move maneuver).

**Can you use an item card or Item token during an active or reactive ability check? For example, to regain stamina or health after you’ve rolled the dice.** No, typically you can’t use items or tokens during an active or reactive ability check, unless the item specifies otherwise. For the majority of items/tokens you'll have to decide to use them before you roll.

**Are Item cards and Item tokens meant to have a limited number available (ex: there are only 3 Potions of Healing)?** Yes, it is designed this way to balance the game. The amount of Item cards/tokens in the game box should be the max limit of those items in the world (of course many consumables get discarded back to the Stock, where they can be purchased or crafted again). For example, Potion of Healing, it is important that you cannot manufacture or buy them endlessly.

**What happens if you gain an item card or item token that is not in the Stock or Archive because all copies of it are already in use?** You instead gain an amount of Star equal to the sale price of the item card or item token.

**What counts towards your encumbrance limit?** Everything your Hero carries with an encumbrance value (backpack symbol) counts toward the encumbrance limit, except for any active items (see below) that your Hero currently has equipped. However, if you were to swap active items during your turn (ex: swap your weapon for a shovel to help with a check), your encumbrance total might change and you may be forced to drop an item if now exceeding your limit. All armor, helmets and robes with a backpack symbol count toward your encumbrance limit, even if you are wearing them, as these are never considered as ‘active’ items.

**What are Active item cards?** Any Item cards with a hand symbol may be assigned as an active item and placed on the left hand side of your Hero board (these items must be active in order to be used). These are typically weapons or tools (ex: shovel, hook & rope). Each Hero has a 2 hand limit (except Matajam with 4 hands). Think of it like this: Active items are the items your Hero is currently holding in its hands. Active items are the only items your Hero carries that do not count toward the encumbrance limit (see above).

**How does swapping Active items work during your turn?** You may completely change your active items once per turn for free. Ex: Swapping two 1 handed items for one 2 handed item, and vice-versa. Further swapping of items during the same turn would cost a maneuver.

**How does the discard symbol (X) on item cards work?** You must discard the item to get the effect. The item gets removed and placed back in the Stock. Many cards in the game are one-time use and must be discarded to be used. Your party will have to buy, craft or find the items again.

**Can Non-Hero Allies, such as Henchman, carry items?** No, Non-Hero Allies do not have an inventory and can not carry items.

**If you get an item that gives immunity to a condition, and you have that condition at that moment, do you immediately discard the condition? And if so, can Heroes pass around the item during a scenario to remove conditions?** Yes, immediately discard the condition if you get a hold of an item with an immunity to that condition (it can be passed around by the Heroes to do so).

**What is a ‘magical’ item?** See errata. ‘Magical’ item(s) should now say ‘rare’ item(s).

**What is a ‘rare’ item?** The back of a rare Item card is highlighted with glinting stars, and planets, and the illustration on the front has a violet background.

**Can Heroes put down a backpack item containing other items and use telekinesis to move the backpack and all its contents?** Yes.

**Item card 058** <span class="hidden">**Rune of the Moons: Can you decide not to roll before using this to maximize the revenge damage?** No, you still need to roll.</span>

**Item card 062** <span class="hidden">**Flame Arrow + item card 068 Void Extract: Does this combo work to defeat all non-elite enemies in the same area?** Yes, you may use 1 poison and 1 arrow for an attack (if your weapon allows it).</span>

**Item card 064** <span class="hidden">**Heartseeker Arrow: Can this be used to kill a non-elite Enemy with unlimited health?** No.</span>

**Item card 064** <span class="hidden">**Heartseeker Arrow: Does the ranged attack need to do at least 1 damage in order to defeat the non-Elite Enemy?** No, simply targeting the enemy with the attack is enough to defeat it.</span>

**Item card 064** <span class="hidden">**Heartseeker Arrow: If a Hero uses this to defeat an Enemy with Revenge, do they take only the reflected damage from the attack roll or the full remaining health of the Enemy?** Only the damage from the attack roll.</span>

**Item card 068** <span class="hidden">**Void Extract: Can this be used to kill a non-elite monster with unlimited health?** No.</span>

**Item card 068** <span class="hidden">**Void Extract: Does the attack need to do at least 1 damage in order to defeat the non-Elite Enemy?** No, simply targeting the enemy with the attack is enough to defeat it.</span>

**Item card 068** <span class="hidden">**Void Extract: If a Hero uses this to defeat an Enemy with Revenge, do they take only the reflected damage from the attack roll or the full remaining health of the Enemy?** Only the damage from the attack roll.</span>

**Item card 068** <span class="hidden">**Void Extract + Cleave attack: Does this defeated all non-elite Enemies targeted by the attack?** Yes.</span>

**Item card 080** <span class="hidden">**Quothian Dirk: Is this considered a dagger for Venia’s Shadow Stalker skill?** Yes, see Shadow Stalker description in the rulebook.</span>

**Item card 081** <span class="hidden">**Tear of Eti: Can you use the first initiative ability with non-attack actions? For example, my Venia character has Shadow Form. Could I spend 3 stamina, go first, Shadow Form, and therefore avoid being the target of enemies?** Yes.</span>

**Item card 089** <span class="hidden">**Wyldkin Wand: If you’re already Cursed before attacking, do you gain Cursed again from the Wand?** Yes, the Cursed condition first gets discarded, then gets reapplied from the Wand.</span>

**Item card 090** <span class="hidden">**Elakira’s Sliver: The description on the item card doesn’t match the description in the rulebook. Which is correct?** The card is correct. Both level 1 and level 2 magic attacks cost 1 fewer stamina (see errata).</span>

**Item card 091** <span class="hidden">**Nafabi Longbow: When do you roll the blue die to see if you keep the discarded arrow?** You can roll immediately after discarding the arrow during your attack (which happens as you declare you attack), or wait till until after you have rolled for damage and finished the attack. The timing doesn't matter so much as long as it's after making the decision to discard the arrow for the attack.</span>

**Item card 100** <span class="hidden">**Gunbanjar Bag: Is this item considered a backpack?** No, you may use this in addition to a backpack.</span>

**Item card 112** <span class="hidden">**Lucky Coin: Can this be used on another player's roll?** No, the effect can only be used for the Hero who is carrying the item.</span>

**Item card 143** <span class="hidden">**Wyldkin Band: Does the roll bonus effect work in city/world events, where stamina is not spent for the successes? Or is this bonus only applied on rolls where you have the option to actually spend the stamina?** Only when actually spending stamina.</span>

**Item card 146** <span class="hidden">**Rakka's Wand: When do you roll the blue die to see if you keep the discarded poison?** You can roll immediately after discarding the poison during your attack (which happens as you declare you attack), or wait till until after you have rolled for damage and finished the attack. The timing doesn't matter so much as long as it's after making the decision to discard the poison for the attack.</span>

**Item card 146** <span class="hidden">**Rakka's Wand**</span> **+ Item card 068** <span class="hidden">**Void Extract: If used to perform an Area Magic attack can this combo used to defeated multiple non-Elite Enemies?** Yes.</span>

**Item card 149** <span class="hidden">**Goblet of Thaxo: The card ability does not match the description in the rulebook. Which is correct?** The card is correct. The updated description should be “Once per City step, you may discard any one Essence token to gain any one Essence token. (see errata)</span>

**Item card 150** <span class="hidden">**Figurine of Lanimora: Can you use the first ability multiple times during the City step?** No, you can only use items during a City step if the card says so, otherwise it can only be used in a scenario. You can use this item multiple times during a scenario, with the only limit being the amount of Nature Essences in the stock (4).</span>

<div class="divider"></div>

## <a name="page_8" class="page-number">8.0</a> Henchman & Non-Hero Allies:

**Can Henchmen or Non-Hero Allies do Active Ability checks on Story cards?** No, Henchmen cannot do optional active ability checks on story cards.

**Can Henchmen or Non-Hero Allies use Hook & Rope tokens?** Yes, they have ability stats on the bottom of their Henchmen cards.

**Does the Weakened condition affect the attacks of Henchmen or Non-Hero Allies?** No, since they don’t roll any dice for their attacks. Weakened could however affect their roll on an active check.

**Does the Cursed condition affect Henchmen or Non-Hero Allies?** No, it does nothing since they don’t have any stamina to spend.

**Does the Vespir Ally always have Fly or does it take an action to activate?** It always has Fly.

<div class="divider"></div>

## <a name="page_9" class="page-number">9.0</a> Scenarios:

### <a name="page_9.1" class="page-number">9.1</a> Scenarios (General):

**Some scenario cards contain a symbol with the letters A/B/C/D/E in the Journey steps. What are those?** These are special locations (shown on the Campaign map as A/B/C/D/E symbols). Special locations have ongoing plots and storylines which advance each time you visit the special location.

**Is the Scenario Setup rules, what are the 3+ or 4 icons on the map?** These refer to the amount of enemies that spawn at different player counts at different spots on the map. At 2 players, ignore all the 3+ and 4 spots. At 3 players use the 3+ but ignore the 4s. At 4 players, you use all the spots.

**Why are there no Story Cards with the letter “I” or “O”?** This is on purpose to avoid the confusion of looking like a “1” or “0”.

**If a story card had multiple success bonuses for a check separated by a comma (ex. Axe, Shovel, Torch +1 success), can you get the bonus for each item or only once for having any one of the items?** You get the bonus for each different item you have as active items. So holding 2 axes wouldn't get you the bonus twice, but holding an axe and a torch would (shovel with an axe/torch as well, although only Matajam could do that as a shovel is a 2-handed item).

**If an active check has a bonus for having a specific herb or item, can you gain it multiple times if you have multiple of those herbs or items?** No, the bonus is only added once even if you have multiples (ex: a check has ‘+1 success for Star Lotus’, even if you are carrying multiple Star Lotuses, you would only gain +1 success for the check).

**When you spawn an enemy during the setup phase, does it follow the spawn rules and skip its first turn?** The enemies that are placed on the map during scenario setup are not considered as spawned so they will act normally in the first round (there is an exception for this in scenario 9 however).

**How does line of sight work with Connecting Story cards that add an extension beyond the Scenario map?** There is only line of sight if the Connecting Story card contains a banner, which acts as a white line (rulebook p.26), otherwise if there is no banner on the card, there is no line of sight from it to the Scenario map.

**What happens to uncollected items and Stars at the end of a scenario?** The heroes may take any items and Star left on the scenario map at the end of the scenario (unless the scenario rules explicitly state otherwise).

**In scenarios with “Special Enemy Movement” (example scenario 5), will enemies prioritize the special movement over attacking an Ally, in some cases moving away from an Ally that is already in attack range?** Yes, the Special Enemy Movement is always prioritized first, and then the enemy will attempt their attack if an Ally is within attack range after the movement. This will lead to some cases where the enemies move away from an Ally they could normally attack.

**If a story card has the restriction "only if there are no enemies in range X", is this measured from the storypoint itself or from the area containing the Hero trying to do the action on the card?** It is counted from the area where the corresponding storypoint is.

**Some Story cards say ‘All Allies Recover:’ or ‘All Allies: Recover:’ followed by the Stamina and/or Damage symbol with a +1. What does this mean?** These cards boost the Recover maneuvers of all Heroes, ie. any Hero that spends a maneuver to recover stamina or health may now recover 1 extra stamina or health. The range at which this effect can be used will be on the Story card.

**For ability checks that allow a Hero to spend/discard an item/token to gain a number of successes: Can you choose to spend/discard after seeing the roll? Can you spend/discard an item/token more than one time?** Yes, you can choose to spend/discard after rolling and you may spend/discard items/tokens multiple times.

### <a name="page_9.2" class="page-number">9.2</a> Scenarios (Specific):

<details>
<summary><b>Scenario 3</b></summary>
<p><b>If Storycard Z is flipped to its overlay side, which removes Story Point Z from the map, can a Hero still use Storycard H to drop down to Story Point Z (which no longer exists)?</b> - <span class="hidden"> Probably? Confirm?.</span></p>
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary><b>Scenario 4</b></summary>
<p><b>When exactly should the first timer begin? Is the Fate card from the end of round 2 used as the first card for the timer?</b> - The first Fate card to go in the timer pile is the one revealed at the end of round 3 (the first Raid card is revealed and resolved at the end of round 2 which instructs you to start a timer).</p>
<p><b>Can Heroes or Enemies make ranged or magic attacks through the crates?</b> - Yes, ranged and magic attacks can be made through double white lines as they do not block line of sight (thematically think of the crates as being waist high).</p>
<p><b>If I gain an ally during the scenario, do I keep it for the next scenario?</b> - No, you only keep an ally at the end of a scenario if it is mentioned in the conclusion.</p>
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary><b>Scenario 5</b></summary>
<p><b>Can Heroes pick up Nightfinger mushrooms during their move maneuvers?</b> - Yes, you can pick them up in the middle of your move, and then continue that movement.</p>
<p><b>Will the Zlohian enemies focus more on the Nightfinger mushrooms than the Allies? If the enemy is in the same area as an Ally, will it still move towards the closest Nightfinger? Does it attack first then move?</b> - Moving always happens before attacking, and its number one priority is the closest Nightfinger mushroom, therefore the enemy will move first towards the closest Nightfinger, potentially moving away from an Ally. After moving, the enemy will attack only if there’s still an Ally within attack range.</p>
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary><b>Scenario 6</b></summary>
<p><b>If a Revenant is defeated, how many rounds until he gets placed back on the scenario map?</b> - You only get 1 full round before the Revenant spawns again. One token will be placed at the end of the same round it’s defeated, then the 2nd token will be placed at the end of the next round, therefore spawning the Revenant again for the following round. Hint: <span class="hidden">This scenario is all about timing.</span></p>
<p><b>Do you keep the Orb item if you succeed in the scenario?</b> - <span class="hidden">No, you need to discard it when you activate the device in the middle of the vault.</span></p>
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary><b>Scenario 7</b></summary>
<p><b>Can a Hero push or pull the Arcane Golem outside of the temple walls?</b> - Yes, that’s allowed, but as the special movement rules states, the Golem would then move back towards an Ally inside the temple walls.</p>
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary><b>Scenario 8</b></summary>
<p><b>How much health does the Bloodrock start with?</b> - The Bloodrock starts with 10x the number of Heroes plus an additional 10 health. The damage symbol (red circle with white down arrow) does not mean damage in this case.</p>
<p><b>How exactly do ranged and magic attacks work when a Hero/Enemy is standing in a Sapfir Tree area? Can they ever be targeted or attacked?</b> - A Hero/Enemy standing in a Sapfir can not be attacked by ranged or magic attack from another area. They can still be targeted and moved towards as normal, and if the attacker were to enter the same Sapfir Tree area (if the capacity allows it), then the attacker could attack with its ranged or magic attack.</p>
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary><b>Scenario 9</b></summary>
<p><b>Story card C 'A Marked Tree' – does this require the Hero who has 'You have discovered some markings' or is everyone in the party considered to have discovered the markings?</b> - Everybody in the party is considered to have discovered it.</p>
<p><b>If two Heroes are in the same area with an intact Wisptree, and the Benaethid performs his bottom area attack, do both Heroes ignore the attack and then the tree is destroyed?</b> - Yes, both ignore the attack.</p>
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary><b>Scenario 10</b></summary>
<p><b>Does a Tussock replace a water area?</b> - No, an area with a Tussock still can be entered as a water area (that’s why there’s an active check to lift yourself up onto the Tussock from the water in the same area). Tussocks simply float on the water area and can be considered as normal ground when standing upon them.</p>
<p><b>Does a Tussock capacity reduce the capacity of the water area it occupies?</b> - A tussock itself does not take up any capacity in an area, but any Heroes on it will. Example: The large tussock (2 capacity), with two Heroes on it, is in a 3 capacity water area, therefore only 1 capacity remains in the water for an Enemy or Hero to enter.</p>
<p><b>This scenario has the ‘replayable’ symbol. Does that mean it can be replayed multiple times to gain an additional experience point?</b> - No, this scenario is meant to only be replayed if you fail the scenario. In this case, ‘replayable’ should be considered ‘re-attemptable’.</p>
<p><b>The rules state the Asputils can’t move into water areas, but can you push or pull them into the water?</b> - Yes, you can. The Asputil would then act normally from that location and would not move anymore.</p>
<p><b>Are Pet figures affected by the water rules?</b> - No, pets can move freely around the water areas and do not trigger the roll from starting their turn in water.</p>
<p><b>Sporal Podlings explode and deal 2 damage to all Allies and Enemies near it when they die. This can lead to a chain reaction where multiple enemies of this type die at the same time, causing further damage. Let’s say a Hero stands next to these enemies and gets wounded from the damage. Are these considered a single event or many sources of damage? Can the player go from healthy to wounded to exhausted at once?</b> - Yes, each damage is dealt separately.</p>
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary><b>Scenario 11</b></summary>
<p><b>In the scenario outcomes, do you only get the reward for crates that are on the wagon, or also ones that you are carrying?</b> - Only the crates on the wagon count.</p>
<p><b>Story card A: Can you place the Barrels of Tentacles on the wagon?</b> - No, the wagon is only for crates (square tokens).</p>
<p><b>What counts as a stolen Barrel of Tentacles (circle tokens)?</b> - A barrel counts as stolen if a Hero is carrying the barrel at the end of the scenario.</p>
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary><b>Scenario 12</b></summary>
<p><b>Does the Giant Slime’s melee attack (range 1) activate if no Heroes are within range?</b> - No, the attack only happens if a Hero is within the attack range.</p>
<p><b>If the Giant Slime uses its Staring Eye action (Acid Splash) or Closed Eye action (Slime Burst) with horns, which triggers the Open Eye action (Bubble and Fizz), does the horn action of Bubble &amp; Fizz also trigger?</b> - No, only the primary effect of Bubble and Fizz.</p>
<p><b>Do Small Slime tokens count as items (for the purposes of items or abilities that let you move items)?</b> - No, they are not items.</p>
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary><b>Scenario 13</b></summary>
<p><b>Do the mushroom areas block line of sight?</b> No, they don't block line of sight. The dotted outlines in this scenario are purely visual to show the outlines of the mushroom areas and are to be considered as single white lines with no height difference. These mushroom areas just have special rules on how the Heroes may enter them.</p>
<p><b>Can you make ranged or magic attack through the mushroom areas?</b> Yes, since they do not block line of sight, ranged and magic attacks can be made through the mushroom areas (thematically imagine it as attacking underneath the mushroom tops).</p> 
<p><b>Can Enemies make melee attacks into the mushroom areas?</b> Yes. The scenario rules state that Enemies may not enter the mushroom areas but they can still attack Heroes in adjacent mushroom areas with a melee attack (magic and ranged attacks too).</p> 
<p><b>Story card H: The 2nd condition states that if there is no Teleporter token in this area, it adds an inactive Teleporter token. Does this inactive token then flip to its active side on the next turn due to the first condition on the card?</b> - No, upon flipping the card, only one of the first two conditions would trigger once (either with or without a Teleporter token). After that only the bottom range 0 ‘Use the Teleporter’ is available (hint: you’ll need to activate the Teleporter in some other way).</p>
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary><b>Scenario 14</b></summary>
<p><b>This scenario has the ‘replayable’ symbol. Does that mean it can be replayed multiple times to gain an additional experience point?</b> - No, this scenario is meant to only be replayed if you fail the scenario. In this case, ‘replayable’ should be considered ‘re-attemptable’.</p>
<p><b>How does movement work between the tiles? Can you only move orthogonally or diagonally as well?</b> - You can move to any area that directly borders the area you are in. Look closely at the map, as the tiles are all offset slightly, meaning you sometimes move in a diagonal fashion.</p>
<p><b>Storycard B ‘Magical Winds’: Who is affected by the push 5?</b> - All Allies and Enemies.</p>
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary><b>Scenario 16 A,B,C</b></summary>
<p><b>Scenario 16 is considered to be 3 separate scenarios, except for the purpose of Henchmen hiring.</b> - See below and errata.</p>
<p><b>Do Heroes heal back to full after completing each part (A, B and C)?</b> - Yes, Heroes fully recover stamina and remove wounded and exhausted statuses. See Recovering After a Scenario in the End of a Scenario section on p.25 of the rulebook.</p>
<p><b>How do items that refer to “once each scenario” work, such as item card 100 or pet card 069 (trained)?</b> - You would gain 1 herb for each part of scenario 16 (A, B and C).</p>
<p><b>How does hiring Henchmen work in this scenario?</b> - Typically a hired Henchman would leave the party at the end of a scenario, but this 3-part scenario is an exception. A Henchman hired in the City step before Scenario 16A will remain with the party for 16B and until the end of 16C (assuming they survive each part). The Henchman may then be paid for and hired again at the end of 16C before beginning 17 (see errata).</p>
<p><b>Do the A/B/C scenarios count as separate scenarios for the purpose of leveling up Henchmen?</b> - Yes, your Henchman may level up at the end of each, assuming he has successfully survived two scenarios.</p>
<p><b>Can the key be targeted and attacked by enemies when it has 0 shields?</b> - Yes, it still has taunt 10 and can be attacked even at 0 shields.</p>
<p><b>Is the key considered an item?</b> - No.</p>
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary><b>Scenario 16A</b></summary>
<p><b>What is the spark token obtained from rewards of the face tiles?</b> - This is a Spark item token (the one that lets you reroll all), not an Argurian spark token from the scenario rules.</p>
<p><b>Are spark tokens considered items?</b> - No.</p>
<p><b>If a Hero is in the same area as the Key, can another Hero move into the same area, spend 5 stamina to add a shield, then move out all in one maneuver?</b> - Yes.</p>
<p><b>If a Hero is in the same area as the Key, can another Hero move into the same area, roll the strength check to pick up the Key and move it?</b> - Yes, as long as the Hero moves out of the area (two Heroes plus the Key don’t fit into the 2 capacity areas).</p>
<p><b>How does a Hero get the Key back from a Golem that has moved into the same area as the Key?</b> - This has been addressed in the errata. If the Heroes deal 6 damage to the Golem, they may enter the area as if it weren’t an Enemy.</p>
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary><b>Scenario 16C</b></summary>
<p><b>How does the shuffling and rotating of the Moving Wall cards work?</b> - Each time you shuffle the Moving Walls deck, randomly rotate some of the cards 180 degrees (turn them upside down, still face down). This is because the Moving Wall cards can be used in either orientation and you are randomizing it. Best way to approach the revealing mechanic of the Moving Walls: Place the Moving Wall deck above the scenario map, rotated 90 degrees so the long side of the cards are parallel to the scenario map’s ‘slot 1’. Then when the walls move, simply flip the top card of the deck (without rotating it) and slide it into ‘slot 1’ in that orientation.</p>
<p><b>Story card W: How do Recover Maneuvers work?</b> - All Allies’ Recover Maneuvers will have a +1 stamina bonus until the end of Scenario 17.</p>
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary><b>Scenario 17</b></summary>
<p><b>Can enemies move between the two start areas?</b> - Yes, when they enter a Start area, they are considered in both maps at the same time (the portal exists in both worlds at the same time).</p>
<p><b>Does the modifier to damage linked to the number of defeated Blood Rubies apply to any damage or just attacks?</b> - Just damage from attacks.</p>
<p><b>How do the two start areas work with attacks and line of sight?</b> - They are considered to be the same area (combined max capacity of 4). You can perform a melee attack on an Enemy in the other start area, but you cannot perform a ranged attack with a bow (minimum range 1). Any magic or ranged attack has obstructed aim if there’s an Enemy in the other start area. You do not have line of sight through the start areas to adjacent areas of the other scenario map.</p>
<p><b>There’s a height difference shown on the top of the stairs on the scenario map. Is this affected by the height rules?</b> - No, because the top of the stairs has a single white line instead of a double white line, so Allies and Enemies can move as normal across that line.</p>
<p><b>Can Heroes move/jump into a breach area that doesn’t have a floating rock in it?</b> - Allies can’t use a movement point or a jump to move into a breach area without a floating rock, but they can spend a full maneuver to move into an adjacent breach area (it's slow moving without the floating rock).</p>
<p><b>I'm instructed to put card 6 Roglu in play. Where do I find this card?</b> It is the Roglu card in the Ally card deck.</p>
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary><b>Scenario 20</b></summary>
<p><b>Storycard J: Entry 678 – Who gets the circle token?</b> - Whichever Hero places the final triangle token.</p>
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary><b>Scenario 24/25</b></summary>
<p><b>Can you push or pull through the Intact Barricades (for example use Torrax’s Grapple)?</b> - No, you may not push or pull through the barricades. Torrax’s Grapple is also a melee attack and is not allowed. Only ranged attacks can be made across the Intact Barricades (and only if in the same area as the barricade).</p>
<p><b>Does a Hero with Item card 145 <span class="hidden">Shadow Goggles</span> or the Sniper or Spell Sniper skill ignore the obstructed aim restrictions from the barricades?</b> - Yes.</p>
<p><b>Can Pet figures move through Intact Barricades?</b> - Yes, pets can get through the small gaps.</p>
<p><b>If an Enemy attacks an Intact Barricade, how much damage does it take?</b> - Treat the barricades as having 0 for each stat (strength, agility, will), so it takes the full amount of damage shown on the Enemy’s attack.</p>
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary><b>Scenario 26</b></summary>
<p><b>How do I unlock this scenario?</b> - It gets unlocked with <span class="hidden">World Event card 023.</span></p>
<p><b>In the Agemonia app, why does scenario 26 show up as unlocked on my map?</b> - It gets unlocked with <span class="hidden">World Event card 023</span>, but it had to be done this way because the app can’t know when you’ve revealed that World Event.</p>
<p><b>With the Graznak Healing rule, does Graznak's third attack effectively heal 2 per damage done?</b> - Yes.</p>
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary><b>Scenario 27</b></summary>
<p><b>Can a Hero pick up multiple runic plates?</b> - No, there can never be 2 in the same area, so that includes a Hero carrying them.</p>
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary><b>Scenario 28</b></summary>
<p><b>Can Allies or Henchmen attempt the Climbing or Leaping active checks on the map?</b> - Yes, they may (check their stats on the bottom of their cards). Any special symbols rolled on the dice will be equal to zero since they have no stamina.</p>
<p><b>Story card H: In order to place a crystal in the chalices, there needs to be “no enemy within range 1”. Does a defeated Phrenipede still count towards this?</b> - Yes, it is still considered an enemy on the map, even when defeated. You’ll have to lure away the Phrenipede (hint: or there might be a way to remove it entirely…).</p>
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary><b>Scenario 29</b></summary>
<p><b>Does the Doom Knights’ snake ability target and pull a different Ally if they are already in an area with an Ally?</b> - No, they don’t pull a secondary target. Like with normal enemy rules, they will concentrate on the closest target.</p>
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary><b>Scenario 30</b></summary>
<p><b>Do the Watchmen move towards an Ally and open doors/windows, even if they don’t have line of sight to an Ally?</b> - Yes, even without line of sight, move the Watchmen as normal, and they can and will open doors/windows if it gets them closer to attacking an Ally. Take into account the extra +1 movement point it takes them to open doors/windows when determining the closest area.</p>
<p><b>Story card C: What Essence tokens is this card referring to?</b> - There are 4 Essence tokens in the game: Nature, Life, Death and Magic. You will need to place 1 of each on this Story card to flip it.</p>
<p><b>Story card Diamond / Enemy Card 3: When the timer reaches its target number, does Wollyon heal to full each time he gets removed and spawned again?</b> - Yes, it’s a new illusion at full health each time.</p>
<p><b>Can ‘Dispel Illusion’ on Story cards J and Q be used to dispel Wollyon’s illusion?</b> - Yes.</p>
<p><b>Do Story cards J or Q need to be on the Hero who is removing/dispelling the illusion on Story cards W and S?</b> - Yes, the Hero dispelling the illusion needs to have either J or Q.</p>
<p><b>During this scenario Heroes may receive a bleeding condition. How does this interact with Item card 105 <span class="hidden">Amulet of Shonosh which states “you are immune to the Bleeding condition”?</span></b> - Item 105 only prevents a Hero from initially receiving the bleeding condition if they are carrying it at the time they receive the bleeding. If a Hero without item 105 receives this bleeding condition, later being given item 105 does not remove it, as the “you may only discard this…” rule now applies.</p>
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary><b>Scenario 34/35</b></summary>
<p><b>The rules state the first three times the timer reaches its number to “spawn all defeated enemies…”. Does nothing spawn if you haven’t defeated any enemies?</b> - Correct, only defeated enemies respawn when the timer hits.</p>
<p><b>Story card H: What does the symbology on this card mean?</b> - It increases or decreases all Recover Maneuvers performed by Allies in this scenario, meaning either +1 or -1 whenever they restore spent stamina or heal damage with a Recover Maneuver.</p>
<p><b>Once the timer reaches its target number for the fourth time, the Storybook entries (040 or 182) instruct you to "Reset the timer". Does this mean resetting the timer according to the rulebook (remove all but the most recent Fate card and start the timer again) or does it mean fully resetting and restarting the timer deck and count again?</b> Ignore the normal 'Resetting a Timer' rules. In this case you should reset/restart the entire Fate deck and timer count: reshuffle all the Fate cards and restart the timer count with a full Fate deck.</p>
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary><b>Scenario 36</b></summary>
<p><b>With the rule “Each time an Ally attacks a Head, modify the attack's damage according to…”, does the modifier apply only to attacks or also to other damaging effects?</b> - No, just attacks.</p>
<p><b>Five-Maw is one enemy and five enemies at the same time, so are status conditions applied to it as a whole or to its heads individually?</b> - Treat each head as a separate enemy, as they are effectively 5 separate enemies. Place the Condition token next to the appropriate head's Health dice. This does mean more than one head may have the same condition. Each head may have up to 2 conditions as per the normal rules.</p>

## <a name="page_10" class="page-number">10.0</a> Heroes (General):

**How does the Tactics skill work?** After you have selected your action, but before the
Initiative card is revealed, you may spend 1 stamina to change your Initiative to any of the three Ally initiatives: Red, Blue or Green (regardless if another Ally has chosen that color initiative or not). You may not choose any Enemy initiative, or the ‘first’ or ‘last’ initiative. 

**What is Armor & Shield Proficiency?** This has been clarified in the 2nd printing rulebook: Armor & Shield Proficiency: You do not need to lock stamina to use armor and shields. See Locking Stamina on p. 28/29.

### <a name="page_10.1" class="page-number">10.1</a> Torrax

**Earth Link (Geomancer skill):** <span class="hidden">**Does this increase the range of Torrax’s Telekinesis (lvl 2)?** No, Telekinesis is not an attack and therefore unaffected.</span>

**Earth Link (Geomancer skill):** <span class="hidden">**Does this increase the range and damage of Torrax’s Earth Bolt (lvl 2) or Earthquake (lvl 4 Geomancer)?** Earth Bolt gets both +1 success and +1 range added to its straight line attack (can now target the first 4 areas in a straight line of sight from your area). Earthquake receives +1 success but no range increase as it has no range (just an area).</span>

**Telekinesis (lvl 2):** <span class="hidden">**Can this be used to move around tokens during a scenario?** Sometimes, as Telekinesis only works on items, therefore the scenario rules must explicitly state that a certain token is an item.</span>

**Telekinesis (lvl 2):** <span class="hidden">**The item moved must be within line of sight and range 3 of Torrax, but when the item is moved, is it moved within range 3 of where the item is, or within range 3 of Torrax?** The movement must end in line of sight and range 3 of Torrax (this may sometimes allow you to move an item 6 spaces, first moving it 3 to Torrax, then 3 more away).</span>

**Stone Form (lvl 4):** <span class="hidden">**While in Stone Form, will Torrax still be targeted by attacks? And if so does Riposte still work?** He can still be targeted, but Riposte will not happen. From the description: “You do not take a turn and may not do anything during any other Ally or Enemy’s turn.”</span>

**Stone Form (lvl 4):** <span class="hidden">**If Torrax has Energy Absorption (Geomancer) marked on himself, does Torrax recover 2 stamina every time he is attacked while in Stone Form?** No, while Stone Form is active, Energy Absorption would only work on another marked Ally.</span>

**Stone Form (lvl 4):** <span class="hidden">**Can you enter and exit Stone Form in the same round? For example, assuming Heroes and Enemies function in the normal red-blue-green order, could Torrax enter Stone Form at red, then tank attacks from blue Enemies, and at the start of another Ally’s green turn, end the ability? Would Torrax then be able to take an action normally next round? Would Torrax recover the five stamina if he prematurely ends the effect?** Yes, you may end the effect at the start of any Ally or Enemy turn, and you will recover the five stamina immediately. The round after that, you would select and play an action as normal.</span>

**Hero Book Level 1 - Entry 03 (Stevedore):** <span class="hidden">**Do the special symbols on rolls count as 2 automatic successes?** No, you must spend stamina in this case. A check will always specify if the special symbol is counted as 2 successes.</span>

**Hero Book Level 2:** <span class="hidden">**If Torrax decides to “Have a drink at the Mossy Stone.” and other Heroes choose to join him, do they also have to spend a City Activity point?** Yes, each Hero must spend a City Activity point to take part in this.</span>

### <a name="page_10.2" class="page-number">10.2</a> Venia

**Backstab (lvl 1 Assassin): Can any pet card in the same area allow the attack to be used?** No, not all pets, as this has been updated to allow only pet figures to be used, therefore pet cards without a figure will have no effect.

**Backstab (lvl 1 Assassin): Can Venia use this from an adjacent space if the targeted area is at max capacity?** No, Venia and the additional Ally or pet figure must be in the same area as the Enemy being attacked.

**Dual Wielder + Shadow Stalker (Assassin skills):** <span class="hidden">**If Venia makes a melee attack while dual wielding two daggers, does she get +2 successes from Shadow Stalker?** Yes, each dagger gives +1.</span>

**Shadow Form (lvl 3):** <span class="hidden">**If Venia loses Invisibility while in Shadow Form, what happens to the locked stamina?** It goes into your spent stamina pile.</span>

**Bounding Charge (lvl 2 Assassin):** <span class="hidden">**Can you use the jump 2 even if you don’t use the attack?** Yes.</span>

**Curse of Aox (lvl 3 Witch):** <span class="hidden">**Does the Curse of Aox token allow other Heroes to drain or just Venia?** Just Venia.</span>

**Curse of Aox (lvl 3 Witch):** <span class="hidden">**Does Venia need line of sight to activate the Drain from Curse of Aox?** No, line of sight is only required for initially applying the curse to an enemy. The drain happens regardless of line of sight or distance until the enemy is defeated or you choose to end the effect.</span>

**Curse of Aox (lvl 3 Witch):** <span class="hidden">**Does the drain damage break Invisibility?** No, as the drain is not an attack.</span>

**Curse of Aox (lvl 3 Witch):** <span class="hidden">**Is the drain damage affected by enemies’ shield values?** No, drain is not an attack, therefore the damage is unaffected by shields.</span>

**Assassinate (lvl 4 Assassin):** <span class="hidden">**Can any pet card in the same area allow the attack to be used?** No, not all pet cards. It must be a Pet figure.</span>

**Assassinate (lvl 4 Assassin):** <span class="hidden">**Can Venia use this from an adjacent space if the targeted area is at max capacity?** No, Venia and the additional Ally or pet figure must be in the same area as the Enemy being attacked.</span>

**Item card 125/126** <span class="hidden">**Urskull: Can this be used with an area attack (ex: item card 062 Flame Arrow)?** Yes, and you drain/heal from all enemies that take damage.</span>

### <a name="page_10.3" class="page-number">10.3</a> Jonai

**Defender of Mion (lvl 1): When does the +1 shield apply?** The +1 shield only applies once you use the action on your turn until the end of the round (it does not provide a bonus before your turn like the Focus action).

**Channel Energy (lvl 1): What kind of rolls does this apply to?** It works on any roll using red or blue dice; attack rolls, action/ability rolls (such as Lunara’s Flash Heal), or any active or reactive check.

**Blades of Wrath (lvl 2 Blademaster):** <span class="hidden">**Can each attack be made against different targets?** Yes.</span>

**Reactive Attack (lvl 2):** <span class="hidden">**Can Jonai select this action if all other Heroes are exhausted?** No.</span>

**Sentinel’s Mark (lvl 3 Aox Hunter):** <span class="hidden">**How does this work?** If it’s a single target attack against the marked Enemy, simply add an extra die to the attack. If it’s an area attack (or other multi-target attack) only add the extra die to the marked Enemy.</span>

**Split in Two (lvl 4 Blademaster):** <span class="hidden">**Does this double the successes only from the roll, or also includes the weapon modifiers before doubling?** It also includes the modifiers, so add the successes from the 3 dice to any other modifiers (weapon, etc.) and then double them!</span>

**Item card 157** <span class="hidden">**Ethereal Crown**</span> **or Item card 158** <span class="hidden">**Breachwalker Crown: Do these use up the helmet slot?** Those items do not use up the helmet slot as they are just ethereal projections.</span>

**Hero Book - ‘Fight Crime’ City Activity:** <span class="hidden">**If another Hero spends Star do they do a separate roll or just add +1 to Jonai’s?** Entry 42 explains this. Everybody rolls a separate roll (+1 to everybody).</span>

### <a name="page_10.4" class="page-number">10.4</a> Drenosh

**Fiery soul (Pyroblade skill):** <span class="hidden">**Will this trigger if a bleed applied by Drenosh kills an enemy (does it count as being defeated by Drenosh)?** No, as bleeding damage is not specific to the Hero who applied it.</span>

**Combustion (Pyroblade skill):** <span class="hidden">**Does this make Fire Blast an area 0 area in addition to range 4?** Yes, Fire Blast becomes a range 4 area 0 attack.</span>

**Charge (lvl 2 Marauder):** <span class="hidden">**Is Jump considered to be movement points for this attack (ex: from Luawa’s Leap Elixir)?** No, only spent movement points.</span>

**Hellfire (lvl 4 Pyroblade):** <span class="hidden">**Can I still add dice to this attack?** Yes, the base attack uses 0 red dice, but you may add more with items or an inspiration gem.</span>

**Chaos Strike (lvl 5 Marauder):** <span class="hidden">**The Rules Reference description indicates this action applies to both melee and ranged attacks, however the action token only indicates a melee attack. Which is correct?** The action token is correct, this is only a melee attack (updated in errata).</span>

**Item card 131-134** <span class="hidden">**Gift of Fire: Can it be used with an item like Cube of Annihilation?** Yes, Gift of Fire works with any attack you make, even if it's with an item like the Cube.</span>

**Item card 131-134** <span class="hidden">**Gift of Fire: Does it affect multiple attacks like from Flaming Fury?** No, Gift of Fire only affects one attack.</span>

### <a name="page_10.5" class="page-number">10.5</a> Matajam

**Dancing Blade (lvl 1): Is the move 1 still affected by an enemy's provoke abilities?** Yes.

**Targeting (Ranger skill):** <span class="hidden">**Can this be used more than once if you have extra maneuvers to spend?** Yes.</span>

**Insect Swarm (lvl 3 Shaman):** <span class="hidden">**Is the Swarm’s damage affected by enemies’ shields?** Yes, Insect Swarm is an attack and therefore is reduced by the shield amount (Insect Swarm is great in some scenarios, but not so good in others with high shielded enemies).</span>

**Insect Swarm (lvl 3 Shaman):** <span class="hidden">**Does the Insect Swarm token count as an Ally?** No.</span>

**Item card 146** <span class="hidden">**Rakka’s Wand: If Matajam makes a ranged attack with a bow and uses a poison arrow, would Rakka’s Wand dice effect be triggered?** No, it would not trigger, as it only applies if you are using the wand for your attack.</span>

**Barkskin (Shaman skill):** <span class="hidden">**Do robes negate the effects of Barkskin or does that count as wearing armor?** No, only armor items (with armor card back) and helm/helmet items negate Barkskin. Robes are loose fitting and therefore work with Barkskin.</span>

**Barkskin (Shaman skill):** <span class="hidden">**If I want to receive the effects of Barkskin, does removing your armor/helm item cost a maneuver?** Yes, just like it costs a maneuver to switch to a different armor/helm item.</span>

**Raging Nalam (lvl 2):** <span class="hidden">**Can you spend stamina for the special symbols rolled with this attack?** Yes.</span>

**Raging Nalam (lvl 2):** <span class="hidden">**Can you boost this attack with items, such as item card 107 Amulet of Power?** No, because it is not a melee, ranged or magic attack.</span>

**Raging Nalam (lvl 2):** <span class="hidden">**Does attacking an Enemy with Revenge trigger damage to Matajam?** No, Nalam does not transfer triggered effects to Matajam.</span>

**Twin Shot (lvl 4 Ranger):** <span class="hidden">**If an arrow or poison is used does the effect apply to both attacks or just one?** No, arrows and poisons only affect 1 attack and since Twin Shot is two separate attacks you’d have to use separate arrows/poisons for each.

### <a name="page_10.6" class="page-number">10.6</a> Zuva’Sai

**What is the Opaque Shape ability?** See errata, this should be renamed as Blurred Form.

**Blurred Form (Telepath skill):** <span class="hidden">**How many rerolls are allowed with this?** Rerolls may happen multiple times during the same reactive check, there is no limit on rerolls. You may keep rerolling all special symbols until you get a result that isn’t a special symbol (although occasionally you may want to stop rerolling to use the special symbol to get an effect from an armor item).</span>

**Exploding Rune (Hydromancer skill):** <span class="hidden">**The skill description in the Rules Reference says this targets “an Enemy in each of 2 adjacent areas” but the symbol for ‘Adjacent Area Attacks’ is described as “Target all Enemies in 2 adjacent areas”. Which is correct?** The skill’s description is correct, it targets an Enemy in each of 2 adjacent areas.</span>

**Infusion (Hydromancer skill) and Item card 073** <span class="hidden">**Aiunin: Can Aiunin be used together with Infusion to recover 5 stamina?** Yes, Infusion is considered a Recover maneuver.</span>

**Guardian of Light (lvl 3):** <span class="hidden">**Does this add +1 heal to items, item tokens, and weapon gems that Lunara uses?** Yes, this passive ability affects any healing ability that Lunara uses, so even item cards like 032 Healing Potion and 044 Scroll of Healing get the +1 heal bonus.</span>
